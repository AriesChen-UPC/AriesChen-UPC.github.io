    <description><![CDATA[The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in weather forecasting marks a pivotal shift in meteorological sciences, combining traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods with advanced machine learning techniques. Pangu-Weather, a large AI model, enhances medium-range global weather forecasting through its innovative 3D neural network architecture, highlighting significant improvements over existing methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.
1. IntroductionHistorically, weather forecasting has relied on NWP, which, despite its precision, suffers from high computational demands.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Geological exploration has long been a domain of meticulous study and analysis, where the subsurface secrets of the Earth are decoded from images that are as complex as they are enigmatic. One of the most powerful tools in this quest has been Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), a technology that peers into the depths of the geological layers without a single shovel strike. But the interpretation of GPR data has remained a highly specialized skill â€” until now.]]></description>
