    <description><![CDATA[Scene of Microtremor
MicrotremorThe microtremor method is a geophysical technique used to measure the natural vibrations of the ground, known as microtremors. These vibrations are typically caused by the movement of the earthâ€™s crust, such as earthquakes, and can be used to study the subsurface structure and properties of the earth.
To measure microtremors, a seismograph or accelerometer is typically placed on the ground at a specific location. The device records the ground motion as a function of time and frequency, and this data can be used to calculate the spectral characteristics of the microtremors.]]></description>
