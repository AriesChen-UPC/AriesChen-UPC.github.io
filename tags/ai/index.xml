    <description><![CDATA[The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in weather forecasting marks a pivotal shift in meteorological sciences, combining traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods with advanced machine learning techniques. Pangu-Weather, a large AI model, enhances medium-range global weather forecasting through its innovative 3D neural network architecture, highlighting significant improvements over existing methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.
1. IntroductionHistorically, weather forecasting has relied on NWP, which, despite its precision, suffers from high computational demands.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Geological exploration has long been a domain of meticulous study and analysis, where the subsurface secrets of the Earth are decoded from images that are as complex as they are enigmatic. One of the most powerful tools in this quest has been Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), a technology that peers into the depths of the geological layers without a single shovel strike. But the interpretation of GPR data has remained a highly specialized skill — until now.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Scene of Microtremor
MicrotremorThe microtremor method is a geophysical technique used to measure the natural vibrations of the ground, known as microtremors. These vibrations are typically caused by the movement of the earth’s crust, such as earthquakes, and can be used to study the subsurface structure and properties of the earth.
To measure microtremors, a seismograph or accelerometer is typically placed on the ground at a specific location. The device records the ground motion as a function of time and frequency, and this data can be used to calculate the spectral characteristics of the microtremors.]]></description>
