      <description>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a state-of-the-art machine learning model developed for natural language processing tasks. It was introduced by researchers at Google AI Language in 2018.&#xA;Key Features: Bidirectional Context: Unlike traditional models that either read text from left to right or right to left, BERT reads text bidirectionally. This allows the model to understand the context of each word in a sentence more effectively.</description>
